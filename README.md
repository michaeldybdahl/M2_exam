# Definition of a problem statement and a short outline of the implementation

## Problem statement
How are the words in the text-reviews and based on a tidy format of the reviews, can we then compute any topics based on this? Can we compute a model that predict if a review is rated as a good review, based or linked to the NLP results?

# Description of data acquisition / how it was collected (by you or the publisher of the data)
The dataset contains reviews of some of amazons products, the dataset can be reached on this website https://data.world/datafiniti/consumer-reviews-of-amazon-products
There are serveral datasets about the same topic, but with different amount of observations, we chose the dataset with $5000$ observations.
The dataset contains 24 variables and 5.000 observations (reviews).

# OBS The notebook cannot be run in google Colab because of the topicmodels package.
